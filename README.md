# Bip39mem - a passphrase reminder

The best way to securely store your passphrase is to remember it :)


## How does it work?

This tool is made to help you remember your passphrase: you'll be periodically
prompted to fill your passphrase and check whether is it correct.

If you once find out that you forgot the passphrase, restore it from currently
used crypto-wallet application.
